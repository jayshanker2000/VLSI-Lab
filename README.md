### Introduction
Verilog is a Hardware Description Language, a textual format for describing electronic circuits and systems. Applied to electronic design, Verilog is intended to be used for verification through simulation, for timing analysis, for test analysis (testability analysis and fault grading) and for logic synthesis.  
Note that VHDL is not an abbreviation for Verilog HDL - Verilog and VHDL are two different HDLs. We used Verilog to program our FPGA.  
FPGA or Field Programmable Gate Array, is a semiconductor IC where a large majority of the electrical functionality inside the device can be changed; changed by the design engineer, changed during the PCB assembly process, or even changed after the equipment has been shipped to customers out in the ‘field’. 
FPGAs provide benefits to designers of many types of electronic equipment, ranging from smart energy grids, aircraft navigation, automotive driver’s assistance, medical ultrasounds and data centre search engines – just to name a few.  
To program our FPGA Spartan 3E starter board we used the environment provided by the ISE Simulator, or commonly known as ISim, which is a full-featured HDL simulator.
